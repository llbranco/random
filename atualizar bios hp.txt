This is the general process I use to flash my BIOS updates on my HP laptops as none of them run Windows. This also is the most-correct BIOS recovery procedure.

Tested on G7-1277DX

Find the "HP Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) Support Environment" for your laptop model from the HP website.
Execute this under windows and create a HP_TOOLS UEFI boot usb stick.
If you can, on your laptop find the "System Board ID" in the bios. (should be a number)
Obtain the latest BIOS update for your laptop
Run phoenixtool on the bios you wish to recover.
- If you have multiple .bin files, pick the one with the number closest to the number from step 3.
You will get two files from phoenixtool...
- RSA.SIG
- <BIOS>F<VERSION>.bin.DEC
Place both of these files on the usb stick at Hewlett-Packard/Bios/Current
- RSA.SIG -> <BIOS>.SIG
- <BIOS>F<VERSION>.bin.DEC -> <BIOS>.BIN
For example:
- 03453F12.bin.DEC -> 03453.BIN
- RSA.SIG -> 03453.SIG
Shut down your laptop, plug the USB stick, hold win + B and power on.
Wait for the system bios to flash.
This USB stick also gives you access to the "System Recovery" feature in the bios if you erased the UEFI partition.
